# Email-sorting-program
Tired of emails that are technically not spam and you cant completely avoid 
but prevents you from focussing on the actually important emails?
Here is a solution.
A gmail sorting program in python that sorts out all the less important emails
as per the specifications of the user by taking the usernames of all those 
unwanted accounts in a text file.
The sorted unseen important emails for a period of 5 days are then displayed on a separate tkinter window.

* Languages used : Python
* External Libraries used : -> Imaplib
                            -> email
                            -> Tkinter
